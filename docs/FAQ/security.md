Security
How does SSL work?
SSL stands for secure socket layer. It has been superseded by TLS or transport layer security. TLS is a secure way of communicating through a network. A majority of secure HTTP communication on the web takes place using TLS. TLS works at session layer and presentation layer of the OSI model. Initially at the session layer asymmetric encryption takes place, after that at the presentation later symmetric cipher and session key are used. The basic principle behind TLS is to encrypt data going across the network using public key encryption first, followed by using a shared key. Also the other component of TLS is server certificate authentication which is done through a certificate authority. Clients contain a list of certificate authorities, and it uses the public key of the CA in the certificate to verify the certificate being authentic.
